###Data Segmentation Project: 
##Global Socio-Economic Clustering
Utilized Python, Pandas for data cleaning, Scikit-learn for KMeans clustering, and Seaborn for advanced visualizations to analyze global socio-economic trends. Applied Box-Cox transformation for data normalization and StandardScaler for feature scaling, focusing on variables like child mortality, income, and GDP per capita. The project demonstrated technical proficiency in statistical analysis and machine learning model implementation, emphasizing hands-on experience with data preprocessing and clustering techniques.
